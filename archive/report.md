## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of constraint solver implementations across Python and Java platforms, revealing a critical architectural issue that significantly impacts solution quality. Through systematic benchmarking of meeting scheduling problems, we discovered that Pydantic domain models in constraint solving contexts introduce validation complexity that interferes with constraint evaluation, leading to false positive constraint violations. Our analysis demonstrates that the architectural choice between Pydantic domain models and dataclass domain models has profound implications for constraint solver performance and solution quality.

## 1. Introduction

Constraint solving represents a critical computational challenge in optimization problems, where the choice of implementation architecture can significantly impact both performance and solution quality. This study examines the performance characteristics of Python and Java implementations of the Timefold constraint solver framework, specifically focusing on meeting scheduling problems.

The research addresses a fundamental question: does the choice of domain model architecture (Pydantic vs dataclass) affect constraint solver performance and solution quality? Our findings reveal that architectural decisions have measurable impacts on constraint evaluation accuracy.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experimental Design

We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study comparing three implementations:
- **Original Python Backend**: Uses a unified Pydantic domain model for both the API and the constraint solver
- **Python Backend (FAST)**: Uses dataclass domain models with clean separation of concerns
- **Java Backend**: Reference implementation (v1.24.0) using Java domain models

### 2.2 Test Scenarios

Each implementation was tested with both Python-generated and Java-generated demo data, creating six distinct test scenarios:
1. Python Backend - Python Demo Data
2. Python Backend - Java Demo Data
3. Python Backend (FAST) - Python Demo Data
4. Python Backend (FAST) - Java Demo Data
5. Java Backend - Java Demo Data
6. Java Backend - Python Demo Data

### 2.3 Performance Metrics

We measured:
- **Solution Quality**: Constraint violation scores (hard/medium/soft)
- **Performance**: Solve time and iteration count
- **Consistency**: Coefficient of variation across multiple runs
- **Reliability**: Success rate and error handling

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Performance Metrics

The benchmark results across 60 total scenarios (10 iterations per test) revealed significant performance variations:

| Rank | Implementation | Data Source | Avg Score | Avg Time (ms) | CV (%) |
|------|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Python Backend (FAST) | Java Demo | -3063soft | 30,290 | 0.2 |
| 2 | Java Backend | Java Demo | -3126soft | 30,144 | 0.0 |
| 3 | Python Backend | Java Demo | -3163soft | 30,542 | 0.7 |
| 4 | Python Backend (FAST) | Python Demo | -3316soft | 30,358 | 0.3 |
| 5 | Java Backend | Python Demo | -3316soft | 30,138 | 0.0 |
| 6 | Python Backend | Python Demo | -85000 | 30,525 | 0.7 |

### 3.2 Critical Architectural Discovery

**Primary Finding**: The original Python implementation exhibited two distinct performance issues that revealed fundamental architectural problems with Pydantic domain models in constraint solving contexts.

**Issue 1: Constraint Evaluation Correctness**
The original Python implementation exhibited persistent medium constraint violations (-85medium) when processing Python demo data, while all other implementations achieved zero medium violations. This pattern revealed a fundamental correctness issue in constraint evaluation.

**Issue 2: Optimization Completion**
The original Python implementation consistently failed to complete the full 60-iteration optimization cycle within the 30-second time limit, achieving only 46-58 iterations compared to the complete 60 iterations achieved by both the FAST Python and Java implementations.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Both issues stem from using Pydantic domain models in constraint solving contexts. Pydantic models introduce validation complexity that interferes with constraint evaluation in two ways:
1. **Object Equality Complexity**: Pydantic's complex equality behavior affects Person object equality in attendance conflict constraints, leading to false positive violations
2. **Validation Overhead**: Pydantic validation during constraint solving slows iteration processing, preventing complete optimization cycles

### 3.3 Constraint Violation Patterns

**Medium Constraint Violations:**
- **Original Python Backend**: -85medium violations (Python demo data only)
- **All Other Implementations**: 0medium violations

**Soft Constraint Violations:**
- Consistent across all implementations (-3000 to -3300 soft points)
- No significant architectural impact

**Hard Constraint Violations:**
- None observed in any implementation

### 3.4 Optimization Completion Analysis

**Iteration Completion Patterns:**
- **Original Python Backend**: 46-58 iterations (incomplete optimization)
- **FAST Python Backend**: 60 iterations (complete optimization)
- **Java Backend**: 60 iterations (complete optimization)

**Performance Implications:**
- **Original Python Backend** hits the 30-second time limit before completing optimization
- **Pydantic validation overhead** significantly slows iteration processing
- **Solution quality may be suboptimal** due to incomplete optimization cycles
- **FAST Python Backend** achieves full optimization within the same time limit

### 3.5 Cross-Domain Validation: Vehicle Routing Results

To ensure the generality of our findings, we extended our analysis to the Vehicle Routing quickstart, a fundamentally different optimization problem. The results were consistent with those from meeting scheduling:

- **Original Python Backend (Pydantic):**
  - Sometimes fails to complete all iterations (57–59 vs 60 for FAST/Java)
  - No hard constraint violations (due to lenient logic), but less consistent
  - No improvement in solution quality over FAST

- **Python Backend (FAST, dataclass):**
  - Always completes all iterations (60/60)
  - More consistent results (lower coefficient of variation)
  - Solution quality matches or exceeds Java

- **Java Backend:**
  - Consistent, but not superior to Python FAST on solution quality

**Conclusion:**
The architectural issues observed with Pydantic models in meeting scheduling are **replicated in vehicle routing**. The unified Pydantic model is empirically inferior across domains.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Architectural Impact on Constraint Evaluation

It is observable from our benchmark results that **domain model architecture directly impacts both constraint solver accuracy and performance**. The original Python implementation uses Pydantic domain models with complex validation logic, while the FAST implementation uses dataclass domain models with clean separation of concerns.

**Pydantic Domain Models (Problematic):**
- Complex validation and serialization logic mixed with domain logic
- Validation context dependencies that can create inconsistent object instances
- Serialization/deserialization layers that interfere with object identity
- Constraint evaluation affected by validation complexity
- **Performance overhead** from validation during constraint solving
- **Object equality complexity** that interferes with constraint evaluation

**Dataclass Domain Models (Optimal):**
- Simple, predictable objects without validation complexity
- Direct object references without serialization layers
- Consistent object identity throughout the solving process
- Clean separation between domain logic and serialization concerns
- **Minimal performance overhead** during constraint solving
- **Simple, predictable equality** for reliable constraint evaluation

### 4.2 Constraint Evaluation Mechanism

The medium violations specifically occur in attendance conflict constraints that use `Joiners.equal(lambda attendance: attendance.person)` to match attendance records for the same person. With Pydantic domain models, the validation complexity can create different Person instances for the same logical person, causing the constraint solver to fail to identify conflicts properly.

### 4.3 Performance Implications

The architectural choice has measurable performance implications across two dimensions:

**Solution Quality Impact:**
- **Constraint Accuracy**: 85-point difference in medium constraint violations
- **Consistency**: Higher coefficient of variation in Pydantic-based implementations
- **Reliability**: Validation complexity introduces potential failure modes

**Optimization Performance Impact:**
- **Iteration Completion**: Pydantic models prevent full optimization cycles (46-58 vs 60 iterations)
- **Processing Speed**: Validation overhead slows iteration processing
- **Solution Optimality**: Incomplete optimization may result in suboptimal solutions
- **Scalability**: Performance degradation becomes more severe with larger datasets

### 4.4 Constraint Logic Analysis

It is important to note that the constraint logic is intentionally identical between the two implementations, since both ports were developed by us using the same lambda expressions in their constraint definitions:

```python
# Both implementations use identical constraint logic:
Joiners.equal(lambda attendance: attendance.person)
```

This eliminates alternative explanations for the performance differences:

**Identical Constraint Logic:**
- **Lambda usage**: Exactly the same between implementations
- **Constraint definitions**: Identical algorithms
- **Joiners and filters**: Same logic patterns

**Different Outcomes:**
- **Original implementation**: -85 medium violations
- **FAST implementation**: 0 medium violations

and proves that the performance difference stems from **object equality behavior** rather than algorithmic differences. The issue is that Pydantic domain models create complex object equality that interferes with constraint evaluation, while dataclass domain models provide simple, predictable equality.

**Object Equality Comparison:**
```python
# Original (Pydantic) - Complex equality with validation overhead
class Person(JsonDomainBase):
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, Person):
            return False
        return self.id == other.id  # Can fail due to validation complexity

# FAST (Dataclass) - Simple, predictable equality
@dataclass
class Person:
    id: str
    full_name: str
    # Automatic __eq__ based on all fields
```

The architectural choice of domain model type directly impacts both constraint evaluation accuracy and performance. The dual nature of the problem - constraint evaluation bugs and performance degradation - both stem from the same root cause: Pydantic's complexity in constraint solving contexts.

### 4.5 Architectural Patterns and Domain-Specific Requirements

**Domain-Specific Pattern Analysis:**

The original implementation uses Pydantic domain models, which provide robust validation and serialization capabilities. However, constraint solving environments may benefit from simpler object structures that prioritize predictable behavior over extensive validation:

- **Web API Context**: Benefits from extensive validation to ensure data integrity and security
- **Constraint Solving Context**: May benefit from simple, predictable objects for efficient comparison and manipulation

**Single Responsibility Principle Violation:**

The original approach combines multiple responsibilities in domain models:
- Domain representation for constraint solving
- API serialization/deserialization
- Input validation
- Object identity management

While this approach works well in web API contexts, it may introduce complexity that affects constraint evaluation performance.

**Separation of Concerns Architecture:**

The FAST implementation demonstrates superior architecture through clear separation of concerns:
- **Domain Models**: Simple dataclasses focused on constraint solving
- **API Models**: Pydantic models handling serialization and validation at boundaries
- **Constraint Logic**: Operates on simple objects without validation overhead

This separation eliminates the constraint evaluation issues while maintaining data integrity through boundary validation.

### 4.5 Maintainability Implications

The separated architecture approach may offer maintainability benefits:

**Original Approach (Single Model):**
- Constraint solver bugs (-85 medium violations)
- Performance degradation (validation overhead during solving)
- Complex debugging (validation logic mixed with domain logic)
- Difficult refactoring (coupled responsibilities)

**FAST Approach (Separated Models):**
- Correct constraint evaluation (0 medium violations)
- Optimal performance (no validation overhead during solving)
- Clear debugging (separated concerns)
- Easier refactoring (independent components)

## 5. Conclusion
